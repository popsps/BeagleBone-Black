'''
- connect pin 1 (left) to power between 2.7V and 5.5V. (P9_3: VDD 3.3V)
- connect pin 3 (right) to ground. in this case (P9_34: GNDA_ADC)
- connect pin 2 to analog in the microcontroller. (P9_40: AIN1)

How to read the analog temperature:
0V at -50C
1.75V at 125C
Temp C = 100 * (reading in V) - 50

Temp in 째C = [(Vout in mV) - 500] / 10

Output range: 0.1V (-40째C) to 2.0V (150째C) but accuracy decreases after 125째C
Power supply: 2.7V to 5.5V only, 0.05 mA current draw
